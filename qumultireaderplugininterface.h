/** \brief Interface for a plugin implementing reader that connects to multiple quantities.
 *
 * \ingroup plugins
 *
 * \li Readings can be sequential or parallel (see the init method). Sequential readings must notify when a reading is performed
 *     and when a complete read cycle is over, providing the read data through two Qt signals: onNewData(const CuData& da) and
 *     onSeqReadComplete(const QList<CuData >& data). Parallel readings must notify only when a new result is available, emitting
 *     the onNewData signal.
 *
 * \li A multi reader must be initialised with the init method, that determines what is the engine used to read and whether the reading
 *     is sequential or parallel by means of the read_mode parameter. If the mode is negative, the reading is parallel and the
 *     refresh mode is determined by the controls factory, as usual. If the mode is non negative <em>it must correspond
 *     to the <strong>manual refresh mode</strong> of the underlying engine.</em>
 *     For example, CuTReader::Manual must be specified for the Tango control system engine in order to let the multi reader
 *     use an internal poller to read the attributes sequentially.
